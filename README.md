# ðŸ¦– Deploy Docusaurus to AWS S3 (Amazon Web Services S3)
This serves as a modified version of the s3-sync-action that syncs a directory with a remote S3 bucket using the standard [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/). The directory can come from your repository or be created as part of your process. Additionally, it executes the yarn run build command to prepare the docusaurs site for deployment.

## Usage

### `main.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```yaml
name: ðŸ¦– Deploy Docusaurus to AWS
on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: docuactions/aws-s3@master
        env:
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: "us-east-1"
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

## Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
